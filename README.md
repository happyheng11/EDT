# EDT - Enterprise Design Thinking project

Enterprise Design Thinking – “How Might We encourage people to adopt a healthy lifestyle so that as the population ages 
it will not be a strain on the health system”. 

Our team followed the Design Thinking methodology – from User Research, Empathy map, Persona creation, As-is and Pain points, 
Brainstorming ideas and prioritization,  Storyboarding, Hill statement, to Prototyping and revision based on User feedbacks.
